<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>One of the biggest challenges to developing a swarm intelligent algorithm is the steps necessary to engineer the swarm’s emergent behavior and decision policy against the almost infinite combination of environmental variables. This project seeks to address that challenge by demonstrating how we can leverage reinforcement learning combined with a policy focused on exploration to train a swarm intelligent algorithm. To accomplish this, this project will first develop a reinforcement learning algorithm focused on Deep Q-Values Neural Networks. Next, this project will introduce the attributes of a swarm intelligent algorithm to determine if a multi-agent reinforcement learning network can develop swarm intelligence. If successful, a context control unit will be overlayed allowign a user to control the swarm. As shown in the image, below, this concept will use a standard reinforcement learning loop. For more discussion on the concept please reference the <a href="https://github.com/SWilliams17655/Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning-Agent/wiki">wiki</a> for this project.</p>
